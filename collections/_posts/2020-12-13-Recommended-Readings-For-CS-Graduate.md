> The following is my own response on the lobste.rs' thread - [Recommended readings for a recent CS graduate ](https://lobste.rs/s/d1c7vd/recommended_readings_for_recent_cs), saved here for reference purposes.

### Things you can consider - (in no particular order)

1. Start following the [morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/) - small pieces of wisdom that you can accumulate everyday
2. [Some book recommendations that every programmer should read - previous lobsters thread](https://lobste.rs/s/wqujvc/books_every_programmer_should_read). Do check out [hwayne@’s response](https://lobste.rs/s/wqujvc/books_every_programmer_should_read#c_ngzhio).
3. You will surely find something interesting to pick at [HackerNewsBooks book aggregator](https://hackernewsbooks.com/) - alongside some fiction/non-fiction too. ~~[NOTE - The site's aggregation functionality has been down for a while]~~ **The site is back up now.**
